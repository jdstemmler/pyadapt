'''
Main read/write utility for the Py-ADAPT package.

Auto-detects the type of files supplied by the main read() function and
calls the appropriate read/write utility.

Usage:
    sounding = pyadapt.read('inputfile.nc')

Returns a 'sounding' object that can then be worked on.

Supported Instruments:
    SOUNDINGS

Supported File Types:
    *.nc
    *.cdf
    *.cdf4
