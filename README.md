## Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit
### Author: Jayson Stemmler <jstemm@uw.edu>

The Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit (Py-ADAPT) is a collection of useful tools for reading and viewing data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. These are tools that I have developed during the course of doing research for the University of Washington - I am not affiliated with ARM in any official capacity. Use of these tools is for informational purposes only and at your own risk. I have done my best to make sure the tools are not doing anything wonky, but feel free to browse the source if you would like.

### Installation

Installation of this package can be done using the standard python install: `python setup.py install` after cloning or forking the repository, or using pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/jstemmler/pyadapt.git` if you'd like to have a non-editable install (you can use the -e flag if you'd like an editable install)

### Use

More to come on this later as I build it out. I will slowly be rolling things into this package, with updates coming frequently. Until I release a 1.x release, all features should be considered 'beta' and as such could break with any new release. I'm pretty new to this stuff, so hopefully you'll be patient with me as I build it.

### Feedback

Feedback can be sent to Jayson Stemmler (<jstemm@uw.edu>) although I might not get back to you in a quick and timely manner. Thanks for checking out the repository!
