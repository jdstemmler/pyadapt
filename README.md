## Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit
### Author: Jayson Stemmler <jstemm@uw.edu>
#### Version 0.0.1 (March 09, 2014)

The Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit (Py-ADAPT) is (will be) a collection of useful tools for reading and viewing data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. These are tools that I have developed during the course of doing research for the University of Washington - I am not affiliated with ARM in any official capacity. Use of these tools is for informational purposes only and at your own risk. I have done my best to make sure the tools are not doing anything wonky, but feel free to browse the source if you would like.

### Installation

Installation of this package can be done using the standard python install: `python setup.py install` after cloning or forking the repository.

### More Information

... can be found in the wiki. That will be updated much more frequently than this README file.

### Feedback

Feedback can be sent to Jayson Stemmler (<jstemm@uw.edu>) although I might not get back to you in a quick and timely manner. Thanks for checking out the repository!
