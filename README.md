## Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit
### Author: Jayson Stemmler <jstemm@uw.edu>
#### Version 0.0.1 (March 20, 2014)

##### NOTE: (2015 Jan 06) - After some stalled development on this project, I will be working to bring this up to speed with most of the instruments available at the ENA permanent site. There should be some good new features coming soon(ish)!

The Python ARM Data Analysis and Plotting Toolkit (Py-ADAPT) is (will be) a collection of useful tools for reading and viewing data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. These are tools that I have developed during the course of doing research for the University of Washington - I am not affiliated with DOE ARM or ASR. Use of these tools is for informational purposes only and at your own risk. I have done my best to make sure the tools are not doing anything wonky, but feel free to browse the source if you would like.

### Disclaimer

This package has been tested using files from the AMF ARM mobile deployment on Graciosa Island in the Azores (site-id: 'grw'). I have not yet done any testing with files from other ARM sites or datastreams. If anyone would like to test them out and report back, that would be great. If you are having issues with a particular datastream, please submit an issue. I am more than happy to get other sites up and going with this package, and I would hope that eventually this package will work on all ARM datastreams (maybe not VAPs - who knows). Anyway, just a heads up that this is in no way a finished-up package yet.

### Installation

Installation of this package can be done using the standard python install: `python setup.py install` after cloning or forking the repository.

### More Information

For examples and easy-to-read use instructions, please refer to the wiki. I will attempt to keep this updated as more features are added. If there's something you would like to see there, let me know.

For documentation of the code, please visit <http://jstemmler.github.io/pyadapt/>. This contains documentation for all of the modules, submodules, and classes utilized within this package. It will probably be the most up-to-date.

### Feedback

Feedback can be sent to Jayson Stemmler (<jstemm@uw.edu>) although I might not get back to you in a quick and timely manner. Thanks for checking out the repository!
